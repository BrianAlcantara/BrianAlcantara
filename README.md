- After over 10 years in B2B sales I became passionate in managing projects, optimizing sales operations, Salesforce and business intelligence.
- I am Salesforce Admin certified and plan to take the Salesforce Business Analyst Certification shortly.
- I love studying the Japanese Language, backpacking and hiking in my free time.
- I created this Github because I love to learn and I have never used HTML in the past and wanted to try to turn my resume into a webpage. You can find it below.

- Shortly <a href="#" style="pointer-events: none;"><img src="Salesforce.png" alt="Salesforce logo"> and then perhaps it is time to get my PMP.
