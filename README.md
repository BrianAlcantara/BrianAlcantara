- After over 10 years in B2B sales I became passionate in optimizing sales operations, Salesforce and business intelligence to help improve sales.
- I am Salesforce Admin certified and will be taking the Salesforce Business Analyst Certification in January.
- I love studying the Japanese Language, backpacking and hiking in my free time.

- Hopefully I can get this soon so I can go back to hiking. <img src="Salesforce.png">
