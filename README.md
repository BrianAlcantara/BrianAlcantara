- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrianAlcantara
- 👀 I’m interested in optimizing sales operations, Salesforce, business intelligence and the Japanese Language.
- 🌱 I am Salesforce Admin certified and will be taking the Salesforce Business Administration Certification in January.
- 💞️ You can find my Tableau Public portfolio at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brianalcantara/vizzes. I really enjoy making dashboards and finding ways to make business intelligence visualization the best it can be.
- 📫 You can reach me at brianalcantara@gmail.com
